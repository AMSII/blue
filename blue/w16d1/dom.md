# DOM 

### Learning Objectives
- Describe the DOM
- Access elements in the DOM
- Add/remove elements to the DOM
- Edit existing elements in the DOM

### Why This Is Important

The DOM is an interface for our HTML and provides us with a structured representation of our document. With it, we can manipulate our HTML so our pages are no longer static data.

In other words, DOM and DOM manipulation is what allows websites to basically do anything dynamic. 

Learning about the DOM and how it fits into the front end also provides us a window into a bit more of how the itnernet works. This is obviously super important to our understanding of what we are learning and how it will fit into the entire web dev process as a whole.

### How We Will Learn This
- Discuss briefly how the front end works
- Discuss what the DOM is and what nodes are
- Traverse the DOM tree
- Play with the DOM

### What is the Document Object Model?
• Long Answer: It's actually an application programming interface for both HTML and XML documents which identifies the interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate data, the semantics of these interfaces and objects - incuding both behavior and attributes, and the relatioships and collaborations among these interfaces and objects, all with adherence to structural isomorphism (if any two Document Object Model implementations are used to create a representation of the same document, they will create the same structure model, with precisely the same objects and relationships). 

• Short Answer: It's a tree.

It's a tree structure interface that represents our HTML and it's elements that we can use to manipulate HTML nodes (elements).
