## HTML Do Now

If you don't know the syntax for how to use one of these tags, what should you first do?

### Directions

<ul>
	<li>Make a folder, W2D1</li>
	<li>Open Sublime</li>
	<li>Save a new file as index.html into the folder you just created</li>
	<li>Use the HTML shortcut to create the HTML skeleton</li>
</ul>

Hint: Typing ```<htm``` creates the skeleton for you!

#### Complete these instructions:

- put something inside the title tag
- h1 that says your name
- h3 that describes where you grew up
- a few p tags describing what you did this weekend
- an ordered list
	* with 3 items regarding 3 things you really like
	* you might want to use a header of some sort to describe the list
- store the list + header you use within div tags
- write a hyperlink to https://www.google.com
- `<a href=" ">`

##### Bonus!

- Include a picture of a cat to your page 
- ```<img src=" " height=" " width=" ">```<br>
- When you do that, I want you to find a way to make it so, when I click the picture, it will LINK to a site of your choosing.
