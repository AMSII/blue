# Week 19 Day 2/3 Assignment

Greetings, everyone.  Hope everyone had a good week 'off'.

Here's the agenda for the next couple of weeks.

### 1. If you <b>HAVE NOT</b> submitted your website to Google Classroom, I'm going to be nice and allow you to submit it by Wednesday, 2/1.  If it's not uploaded to the Classroom in the way I explicitly said, you'll be getting a 55.

### 2. We're going to slowly jump back into coding.  We'll take a little break from JS, though.  Instead, at least starting Thursday and going into Friday, I'm going to be showing you a way to create responsive CSS utilizing a very popular library.  You'll be able to make things like... 

- Navigation bars
- Dropdown menus
- Picture sliders

### 3. At the minimum, before you can go to step 4, you must have the following done.

- Website
- Typing Club 250 (nothing new... yet)

### 4. If you're done with the above, I know a lot of you have Online Gym.  Take the next two days to work on that as a sign of good will.  When we start coding again, I want your undivided attention. 

Or you can play this game... it's actually pretty entertaining.
