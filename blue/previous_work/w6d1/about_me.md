## About Me

### Overview

This is going to be your first major assignment in this class.  The idea behind this assignment is that we'll build out the HTML/CSS portion of your "about me" now, and then we'll add on top of it as we acquire more knowledge (especially when we hit JavaScript).  

What I want to see is you guys use the different types of styling we've used up until this point, and I want you to create a website that'll show what you're all about.  This site should really show someone what type of person you are (think college recruiter?).  Thus, you'd probably want to include a summary of yourself, a list of likes/dislikes...  

### Requirements 

In order to fulfill your MVP's (Minimal Viable Product), you'll need to...

<ol>
	<li>index.html and styles.css in a dedicated folder</li>
	<li>summary of yourself</li>
	<li>picture of yourself</li>
