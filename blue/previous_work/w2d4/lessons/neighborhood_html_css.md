# HTML AND CSS - making a webpage

Do not make this bad page:  

![crap site](http://cdn-webpagesthatsuck.com/crha.jpg)


### Instructions

1. Scaffold a basic html and css webpage -- link together an `index.html` and a `style.css` using the `link` tag. Your page will be about six nyc neighborhoods that you particularly like, or alternatively, dislike.

2. Your webpage should have 
 	- a background color using a hex value
	- h1 header centered on the page
	- a small blurb saying what the page is about (should this be a p tag?)
	- six clickable images of the neighborhoods (one image per neighborhood)
	- sized fonts giving a caption or explanation for each image (hint: you might want to use a class on p tags)
	- the images should click through to a page that displays two articles about that neighborhood (feel free to use lorem ipsum for text).
	- each image should have a class that gives them a uniform size and a border-radius.
	- a nav bar that also links to the neighborhoods
	- Put your images and text inside a container div and center that div.
  - Lay out your images and text in a 3 x 3 grid inside the container div.
	

##### Bonus
3. Add some social network sharing buttons in the footer (they don't need to function at all, just for visuals for now)
4. Add Google Fonts and include a Google Font in your page.

#### Make it look nice

It should look nicer than the Colorado Ranger Horse Association webpage :>
