Here's some sample CSS stuff if you'd like to use/manipulate it.

Reminder: you can adjust whatever you'd like to adjust.  These are just examples for you to follow, just in case!

Sizing images/divs/whatever you need:

img{
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
}

Changing font:

h1{
  font-family: "Helvetica";
  font-size: 14px;
  color: orange;
}

Align text to center of page:

body{
  text-align: center;
}

If you want something to happen when you hover over something with your mouse:

a:hover{
  background-color: blue;
}

div:hover{
  background-color: green;
  font-family: 'Arial';
  font-size: 20px;
}

etc etc...
