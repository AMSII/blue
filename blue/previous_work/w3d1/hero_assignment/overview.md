## Hero 

For our first in-class assignment, I'd like you all to dedicate a website towards your hero, or someone that you look up to.  

### Objectives

Using some of the HTML tags, and CSS stylings that we've learned so far, I'd like you to create your first complete website.  The page should be transformed completely.  Feel free to use the color wheel or w3schools.com.  

### Requirements

I'm going to keep this assignment fairly open. I want to see a substantial amount of text and images.  You should discuss why this person is important to you, and (pertaining to sports), include some noteworthy stats.  If the person is a writer, include some writing samples.  Be creative, and think about how you want your page to look.
