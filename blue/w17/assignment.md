# Week 17 Assignment

Seeing as how this week is RTR, and the periods are shortened, and most of you won't be in school next week, we will be doing the following this week.  The completion of all three is due on Friday.

1. Typing Club - Up to Level 250

2. Design a website as a thank you to Mr. Deokule.  Maybe include some of the things about Google that stood out to you, and maybe ask him some questions if you're curious. 

3. Mr. Deokule, while at Google, talked about how him and his team did team-building exercises to learn/freshen up on CSS.  We are going to try doing the same thing!

Choose one of these two games to complete by Friday.  Show me that you've completed it to earn the maximum points.

<h1>This one is called CSS Diner.  This will teach you about the different types of CSS Selectors</h1>

<h2>https://flukeout.github.io/</h2> 

<h1>This one is called Flexbox Froggy.  This is the game Jon played with his team.  This will teach you about dynamically moving your elements around the page using a property called "Flexbox".</h1>
